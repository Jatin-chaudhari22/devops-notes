## Disk Management


## 1. Viewing Disk Space

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `df -h` | Show disk usage of all mounted filesystems in human-readable format. |
| `df -T` | Show filesystem types along with usage. |
| `lsblk` | Display information about all block devices (disks and partitions). |
| `blkid` | Show block device UUIDs and filesystem types. |
| `du -sh <directory>` | Show total size of a directory. |
| `du -ah <directory>` | Show size of all files and subdirectories. |

---

## 2. Partition Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fdisk -l` | List partition tables of all disks (requires sudo). |
| `sudo fdisk /dev/sdX` | Open interactive partition manager for disk `/dev/sdX`. |
| `parted /dev/sdX` | Modern tool to create, resize, and manage partitions. |
| `lsblk -f` | Show partitions with filesystem types and labels. |

**Tip:**  
- Backup data before modifying partitions.

## 3. Filesystem Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1` | Create an ext4 filesystem on partition `/dev/sdX1`. |
| `mkfs.xfs /dev/sdX1` | Create an XFS filesystem on partition `/dev/sdX1`. |
| `mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt` | Mount a partition to a directory. |
| `umount /mnt` | Unmount a mounted partition. |
| `lsblk -f` | Verify mounted partitions and filesystem types. |

## 4. LVM (Logical Volume Management)

LVM allows flexible disk management by abstracting physical disks into **Volume Groups (VGs)** and **Logical Volumes (LVs)**.

### Basic LVM Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pvcreate /dev/sdX` | Initialize a physical disk for LVM. |
| `vgcreate <vg_name> /dev/sdX` | Create a volume group with one or more physical volumes. |
| `lvcreate -L 10G -n <lv_name> <vg_name>` | Create a logical volume of 10GB. |
| `lvextend -L +5G /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>` | Extend an existing logical volume by 5GB. |
| `lvreduce -L -5G /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>` | Reduce a logical volume (use with caution!). |
| `lvdisplay` | Show logical volume details. |
| `vgdisplay` | Show volume group details. |
| `pvdisplay` | Show physical volume details. |

### Mounting Logical Volumes

```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name>    # Format LV
mount /dev/<vg_name>/<lv_name> /mnt  # Mount LV



```

## 5. /etc/fstab

The /etc/fstab file is used to configure automatic mounting of partitions, disks, and logical volumes at boot.

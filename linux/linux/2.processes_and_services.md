# Process and Service Management

## 1. What is a Process?

A **process** is simply a program in execution. Every process is assigned a **unique PID (Process ID)**.

### Essential Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ps aux` | Displays a snapshot of all running processes. |
| `top` | Real-time, interactive view of running processes. |
| `htop` | User-friendly, colourful version of `top`. Highly recommended for DevOps. |
| `kill -9 <PID>` | Forcefully stops a process that is stuck or misbehaving. |

## 2. Process States

Processes move through different states during their lifecycle:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Running (R)** | Currently using the CPU. |
| **Sleeping (S)** | Waiting for an event to occur (like user input). |
| **Stopped (T)** | Suspended by a signal. |
| **Zombie (Z)** | Process has finished execution but still has an entry in the process table. |

## 3. What is a Service?

A **service** (also called a **daemon**) is a type of process that runs in the **background** and performs specific tasks without direct user interaction. Services are commonly used to:  

- Keep applications running continuously  
- Handle system-level tasks (like logging, networking, or scheduling)  
- Start automatically when the system boots  

In Linux, services are usually managed using **systemd** via the `systemctl` command.

## 4. Service Management (`systemd`)

Instead of running applications manually, DevOps engineers run them as **services** so they stay active and manageable.

### Service Lifecycle Commands

| Action | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Start** | `sudo systemctl start <name>` | Starts the service immediately. |
| **Stop** | `sudo systemctl stop <name>` | Stops the service immediately. |
| **Restart** | `sudo systemctl restart <name>` | Stops and starts the service (used after config changes). |
| **Status** | `sudo systemctl status <name>` | Shows if the service is running or has errors. |
| **Enable** | `sudo systemctl enable <name>` | Configures the service to start automatically on boot. |
| **Disable** | `sudo systemctl disable <name>` | Prevents the service from starting at boot. |
